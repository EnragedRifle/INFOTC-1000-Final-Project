### Surface Warfare Officer

Within the Navy you have different communities. Surface Warfare, Aviation, Subsurface Warfare, and Special Operations/EOD.

I want to be a Surface Warfare Officer meaning I will be trained and qualified in navigation and driving of a warship. In addition to navigation, I will also have a group of sailors that I am responsible for leading to accomplish specific missions onboard.

As for the type of ship I'd like to serve on, I absolutely love destroyers (See below)

            try:
               value = float(input(prompt))
               if (value < 0):
                   print("Please enter a non-negative number.")
                   continue
              break
            except ValueError:
                print("The value you entered is invalid. Only positive numerical values are valid. Please reenter.")
        return value
