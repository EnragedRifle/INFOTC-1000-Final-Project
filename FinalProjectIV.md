### What is _summer cruise_

Summer cruise is training for the Navy where I see how the fleet operates.

***What kind of workouts will I be doing?**

Hopefully a lot of freeweights and lifting. I want to improve my deadlift form this year.

I've been reading up on how I can improve like at the sight linked below.

##### More Code!

     list1 = ['a','b','c']

     list2 = ['d','e','f']

     list3 = list1 + list2
