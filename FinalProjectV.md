My Major
===============

Spoiler: It's Awesome
------------------------


#### Top 3 reasons I like my major:

1. The instructors understand how/why/when collaboration is important and trust
us to use it responsibly
2. The willingness for people to help is astounding
3. Technology is Awesome
4. You get to see the development of your skills in real time

The first language I 'learned' is _Python_.

There are **tons** of languages

## My first lines of code _ever_

    print('Hello, World!')

Hello world is a pretty universal introduction to the world of coding!
